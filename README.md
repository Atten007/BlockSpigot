# BlockSpigot
BlockSpigot will be a webpage, where users can create free / paid spigot plugins with Google's Blockly.

## About
I founded it to make spigot plugin development as easy as possible. The webpage will soon be available on https://blockspigot.com. A user account is needed to share plugins on BlockSpigot. A SpigotMC account is required if you want to upload plugins on https://spigotmc.org.
